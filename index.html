                    The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
                    displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and
                    scripting languages such as JavaScript.

                    CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
                    written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
                    alongside HTML and JavaScript.

                    JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript
                    specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled and multi-paradigm. It has
                    dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation and first-class functions.
